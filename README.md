# web_devp_project
This is a frontend sales website.
It uses Html and Css.

Basic idea :
-to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers(typically farmers).
-buyers can purchase items by viewing the prices offered by different sellers.

#this part of the project deals with the buyers and not about hosting of products by producers.
